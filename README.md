# File Conversion

This is python program to do convert any file from one format to another. This internally uses API call from [Anyconv](https://anyconv.com/). This is an attempt to automate if there are more conversion to do. info.json contains the basic input required for the program to run. Another inportant thing is to replace the cookie in the templates file.

## Features

* Can convert any file from one format to another.
* Simple interface just need info.json as the input to the file.


## Usage


```
python file_conversion.py
```

This will read the info from the info.json and will convert the file in provided location.

## Motivation

To automate the file type conversion this was integrated. It is time consuming when we are dealing with more than 100 files to convert from one type to another. In order to avoid such delay in conversion this was created.
